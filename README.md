# PropertiesComparator
A quick program to compare `.properties` files for Mindustry.

Put at least the `bundle.properties` and one `bundle_XX.properties` into the same folder as the program, then run.

The program will output all tags that are not present in `bundle_XX.properties` but are present in `bundle.properties`.
